# Minimal Example Env Typetree

Here is a minimal example about something I do not understand with the typed tree of the OCaml compiler: how to retrieve an environment from the OCaml AST. To get into the error:
```
make
```

Example tested with OCaml 4.05.0, but I cannot make this work with OCaml 4.07 either.
